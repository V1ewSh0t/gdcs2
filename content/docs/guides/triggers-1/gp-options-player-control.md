- The Options Trigger is essentially a toggle trigger for player related actions. To toggle them back on or off use another one with opposite settings.
- The Player Control trigger stops you from performing a certain action until you perform it again.

# 1: Options Trigger

The Options trigger lets you control the player's actions and controls, but the changes are permanent until you use another Options trigger to disable those options. Think of this as a complex toggle trigger.

* **Streak Additive:** Toggles blending of player trail and particles.
* **Hide Ground:** Hides the ground.
* **Hide MG:** Hides the midground.
* **Hide P1 or P2:** Hides the corresponding player *similar to the Hide Player trigger* {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/HidePlayer.png" class="emote">}}.
* **Disable P1 or P2 Controls:** Toggles a corresponding player's controls. *Useful during cutscenes or dialogues*.

* **Unlink dual gravity:** Allows dual players to switch gravity independently. Normally, different gamemodes can have linked gravity, and toggling this option lets both icons have independent gravity, regardless of gamemode. Learn more about the quirks of dual gravity [here](/docs/guides/gameplay-1/making-duals/).
* **Hide attempts:** Hides the attempt counter at the start of a level.
* **Audio on death:** Continues to play music and SFX after the player dies.
* **No death SFX:** Stops the Death Effect sound from playing, when the player dies.
* **Edit respawn time:** Allows you to edit the time that it takes for a player to respawn via the Respawn Time slider at the bottom of this page.
* **Boost Slide:** Increases sliding after a force is applied.

# 2: Player Control Trigger

This is another useful trigger that controls the player behavior. With it you can control whenever a player should stop performing a certain action until they hit a certain key again.

Do not confuse this with {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/GPOptions.png" class="emote">}}, as they are separate triggers.

* **P1 or P2:** Determines whenever a certain setting should apply to player 1, 2 or both.
* **Stop Jump:** Prevents the player from jumping again unless they hit the jump button again. *This option works similarly to the J block.*
* **Stop Move:** Prevents the player from moving unless they hit the corresponding key again.
* **Stop Rot:** Stops player's rotation.
* **Stop Slide:** Can be used to stop the player from sliding after a force has been applied.
