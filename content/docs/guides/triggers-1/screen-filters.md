- Shader Triggers alter the player’s and level’s qualities and colors.
- Shader Triggers are divided into two categories: Screen effects and Color filters.
- Screen effects distort the screen and the player, while Color filters change the colors of the player and the level.

Shader triggers/screen filters apply a filter to a level, affecting the level itself and the player. Shader triggers alter the level’s colors and qualities, and can make effects that can’t be replicated with regular objects. This guide will teach you how to use all of the shader triggers.

Generally, shaders can be divided into 2 categories: Screen effects and Color filters. **Screen effects** distort the screen in some way, shape, or form, while **Color filters** change the color or hue of the level.

- Shader triggers cannot be stopped using a stop or pause trigger. You have to use the same trigger with all of its settings off, or the shader trigger with “disable all” enabled.
- Checking the box in the top right of the shader menus disables the shader from previewing in the editor. The relative checkbox makes the effects relative to a screen’s aspect ratio rather than a fixed amount.

# 1: Screen Effects

## Shader

**{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/Shader.png" class="emote">}} Sets a range of Z layers that other shader triggers will affect.**

* The cyan buttons are the minimum and maximum layers.
* The green buttons are layers affected by the other shader triggers.
* The gray buttons are layers unaffected by the other shader triggers.
* **Disable All**: **Disables any active shaders**.
* **Disable player particles**: **Prevents any shaders from affecting the particles that come from the player during gameplay**. This option is here since the rendering of some shaders on these particles can look a bit weird.

## Shock Wave

**{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/ShockWave.png" class="emote">}} Creates a shock wave that moves to or from a center point.**

* **Speed**: **How fast the wave will move**. Higher values mean higher speed.
* **Strength**: **The amount of distortion of the wave**. The higher the value, the more distorted objects will be in the wave.
* **Thickness**: **How “long” the wave is**. The higher the value, the longer the wave of the effect will last. Generally, if the thickness is higher than the wave width, multiple waves will spawn to fill the gap of time, however the ratio is not 1:1 and more like 1.5:1 (in the thickness’s favor).
* **WaveW**: Stands for “Wave Width”. **Sets the width of each wave**. The higher the value, the wider the wave.
* **FadeIn**: **How smooth the wave will fade into distortion**. In other words, this affects the outer part of the *first* wave in a wave sequence.
* **FadeOut**: **How smooth the wave will fade out from distortion**. In other words, this affects the inner part of the *last* wave in a wave sequence.
* **TimeOff**: **The amount of seconds the effect will be offset by**. Negative values will delay the start of the waves, positive values will start the waves at an earlier point of the effect (This does not start the effect before the trigger is activated, think of it as the song offset but for an effect).
* **MaxSize**: **The maximum distance the waves can travel**. 0 is the default and leaves no limit.
* **ScreenOffX**: **The X offset of where the waves spawn**. Negative values go left, positive values go right.
* **ScreenOffY**: **The Y offset of where the waves spawn**. Negative values go down, positive values go up.
* **Invert**: **Inverts the movement of the wave** so that it spawns waves that go from the edge of the screen to the center.
* **Inner**: **How big the radius of distortion is from the center of the screen**. Basically creates a circle you set the size of that distorts the area it is in as waves get to it.
* **Outer**: **How far the waves spawn away from the center of the screen**. The waves will travel the same distance as before, so higher values may not be seen without any offset.
* **Target**: **Sets the center of the effect to a player or a single object using a group ID**. The default position of this option is around 3 blocks under the player’s spawn point.
* **Follow**: **If enabled, the center of the effect will follow the Target if it is moving**. If not enabled, the center of the effect will stay at the place the Target was at when the shader was originally activated.
* **Animate**: **Allows you to change the settings of an active shock wave effect**. Pressing the trash button next to a setting will have that setting ignored.
* **FadeTime**: **How long the effect lasts**. To the right are some easing options for the transition.

## Shock Line

**{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/ShockLine.png" class="emote">}} Creates a shock wave effect that moves across the screen.**

* **Speed**: How fast the wave will move. Higher values mean higher speed.
* **Strength**: The amount of distortion of the effect. The higher the value, the more distorted the effect will make objects.
* **Thickness**: How “long” the wave is. The higher the value, the longer the wave of the effect will last. Generally, if Thickness is higher than the Wave Width, multiple waves will spawn to fill the gap of time, however the ratio is not 1:1 and more like 1.5:1 (in the thickness’s favor)
* **WaveW**: Stands for “Wave Width”. Sets the width of each wave. The higher the value, the wider the wave.
* **FadeIn**: How smooth the wave will fade into distortion. Basically effects the outer part of the *first* wave in a wave sequence.
* **FadeOut**: How smooth the wave will fade out from distortion. Basically effects the inner part of the *last* wave in a wave sequence.
* **TimeOff**: The amount of seconds the effect will be offset by. Negative values will delay the start of the waves, positive values will start the waves at an earlier point of the effect (This does not start the effect before the trigger is activated, think of it as the song offset but for an effect).
* **MaxSize**: The maximum distance the waves can show up from in the center of the screen. 0 is the default and leaves no limit.
* **Invert**: **Inverts the amplitude of the wave**. Basically it turns the high parts of the wave to low parts and vice versa.
* **Flip**: **Reflects the effect so that it moves from the opposite side of the screen**.
* **Rotate**: **Rotates the effect so it moves along the y-axis instead of the x-axis**.
* **Dual**: **Spawns two waves that spawn at the center of the target that move away from each other**.
* **Target**: Sets the center of the effect to a player or a single object using a group ID. The default position of this option is around 5 blocks to the right of the player’s spawn point.
* **Follow**: If enabled, the center of the effect will follow the Target if it is moving. If not enabled, the effect will stay at the place the Target was at during the original activation of the shader.
* **Animate**: Allows you to change the settings of an active shock line effect. Pressing the trash button next to a setting will have that setting ignored.
* **FadeTime**: How long the new changes will take effect. To the right are some easing options for the transition.

## Glitch

**{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/Glitch.png" class="emote">}} Creates a glitch effect.**

* **FadeTime**: **How long, in seconds, it takes to transition into the effect**.
* **Strength**: **How strong the distortion is**. It is a multiplier for the other adjustable settings.
* **Speed**: **How fast each glitch will occur**. Higher values mean more glitches happening per second.
* **SliceHeight**: Slices are horizontal strips that offset the visuals within them. **This setting sets the *max* height these slices can be**.
* **MaxSliceXOff**: **How much each slice can distort objects from its original x-axis**.
* **MaxColXOff**: **How far the RGB values can be offset from its original x-axis**.
* **MaxColYOff**: **How far the RGB values can be offset from its original y-axis**.

* **Speed**: **How fast the distortion effect moves**.
* **RGBOff**: **How far from the x-axis the color split is offset**. Negative values can be entered to offset it to the right.
* **Strength**: The amount of distortion of the effect. Higher values mean more distortion.
* **FadeTime**: How long in seconds it takes to transition the effect. Easing options at the bottom give easing for the transition.
* **LineThickness**: How wide the horizontal lines on screen are.
* **SegmentH**: **How high each segment is (how far apart they are)**. Each segment is marked by the lines on screen.
* **LineStrength**: **The opacity of the lines**. Lower values make the lines more transparent.
* **Disable**: **Disables the effect**.
* **Relative Pos**: **Locks the segments to the grid instead of them following the camera**.

# 2: Color Filters

## Grayscale

**{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/GrayScale.png" class="emote">}} Filters the screen to a grayscale color**.

* **Tint Channel**: Uses a color channel to tint the screen by instead of gray. The box next to the input must be checked in order to work.
* **UseLum**: **Uses a different color conversion method for the grayscale filter**. Instead of simply desaturating the end image, it applies a “value” filter which is more accurate for [color theory](/docs/guides/deco-2/light-3-value/).

{{< youtube VLX5-fKeYpg >}}

## Sepia

**{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/Sepia.png" class="emote">}} Filters the screen with a sepia effect**.
