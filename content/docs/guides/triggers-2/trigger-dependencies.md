# What Are Dependencies?
Triggers technically are **functions** - they take various **inputs** *(e.g. groups, delays, ect)* and perform **outputs**. These outputs can range from changing object properties *(such as position, rotation, scale, color, ect)* to triggering **other triggers**. Functions can be either **Independent** or **Dependent.**

## Independent Functions
**Independent** functions are functions that work completely on their own. This means the set of their inputs is fully disjoint, and neither trigger is an action of the other.
- **Fully disjoint** means both functions or in our case, triggers share no inputs. They target/use completely different groups, item ids, ect. and no object shares inputs used by both triggers. *(e.g. having groups both triggers target)*
- **Neither trigger is an action of the other** means they don’t activate each other. Note that this means triggers activated as part of the same function can still be independent from each other


- **Spawn-activating triggers** operate **independently** from non trigger objects. *(e.g. you can add a trigger and a block to group A, and spawning/stopping that group doesn’t affect the block at all)*

## Dependent Functions
**Dependent** functions are functions that **depend** on another produce an output.

For example, activating a rotate trigger **before** a move trigger when the object is off center will make the object to rotate first, then move, causing the object to **rest outside the original objects circle of revolution.** Activating the rotate trigger **after** the move trigger will **shift the circle of revolution**, increasing or decreasing its size, but keeping the rotating object aligned with it.

Other examples include:
- **Item edit triggers** and PEMDAS order of operations
- **Compare triggers** with conditional operations and logic gates
- Any **Object State Changing** or **World State Changing** triggers

- Any other **Priority bugs** that may occur *(e.g. invert/multiply gradient triggers disabled by shaders)*

This means **many trigger output combinations** are **noncommutative**, since they’re dependent on each other, their relation isn’t symmetric.

- **Object State Changing:** Any trigger that changes object properties such as position, rotation, scale, color, ect.
- **World State Changing:** Any trigger that changes world properties such as the background, mid-ground, and ground textures and colors, camera movements, rotations, scales, shaders, ect.
- **Noncommutative:** Operations that are dependent on order of application. Inversely, commutative operations do not depend on order of application.
- **Circle of Revolution:** The circle created from the center and a point that rotates around the center.

### Reversal
Reversing dependent trigger operations require **reversing** the **original order of operation.** 

For example, reversing **move, rotate, scale** operations in sequence requires **scale, rotate, move** operations in sequence.

For move and rotate triggers, utilizing the **target options** can significantly help with reversal as those specific operations are **commutative** as they don't change values, they set them.
{{< callout context="caution" title="Warning:" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}

Depending on certain delays and durations, you may be required to **configure the triggers in unconventional ways.**

For example, reversing this operation:

- Activating a **move trigger** with a `1.00` second duration and a **rotate trigger** with a `0.5` second duration + `0.5` second delay from the move trigger activation.

requires activating a **move trigger** with a `1.00` second duration + reversed movement and a **rotate trigger** with a `0.5` second duration, a reversed rotation, and a **distance of `3.5` units to the right** of the move trigger.

# Why does this matter?
Many trigger setups **Include dependencies** that can easily cause issues if not properly handled. For example:
- Activating an **Advanced Follow** trigger to have an object follow the player **After** a normal **Follow** trigger connected to a sprite and the center object can make the sprite **missaligned** with the player.

When changing one part of a system, **everything else has potential to change too.** This can increase workload and make the system more prone to errors. For example:
- Creating a **ground collision function** that checks to see if collision block `1` is colliding with collision block `2` and **changing** collision block `1` to be collision block `3` can **break** another unrelated system that uses collision block `1` to detect damaging objects.

## Managing Dependencies

**Anchor operations** - things you can use to explicitly set trigger operations with. While **not independent**, they can give a **Point of Reference** for various operations.
- Ex: Instead of reversing a move triggers operations, requiring **Relative Position operations** *(e.g. +20x -13y)*, utilizing the **target function** can allow for setting **Absolute Positions** *(e.g. to 100, 12) (assuming that absolute position, doesn’t move either)*


Utilizing **tracking objects and item ids** can help **display** the statuses of various dependencies. Some tracking types include:
- **Timer** and **Item IDs**, either stationary, following the player, or as a **UI element**
- **Background Pulses** or **Blank Objects** to indicate when something activates.
- **Text Objects** that toggle on and off depending on what action is being performed.

### Dependent to Independent
**Converting dependent operations into independent operations** can help keep operations seperate and easily reversable.

For **Object State Changing** operations, utilizing **Area Triggers** is one of the best ways to keep operations independent as area triggers are **commutative.** 

(Image goes here)

Breaking seperate operations into **seperate objects** can help keep said operations from **interfering** with each other. Easiest to show with move & rotate example:
- Move triggers **change the distance at which objs rotate**, which impacts the rotation on its way back
**Separate** the rotation from the movement by having an independent group do the rotation, then **copying the change** in position via a **follow trigger**. Does lead to slightly different results but actually reversible

{{< callout context="note" title="Note:" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}

Follow triggers have dependencies with move triggers but they dont affect each other based on order **as long as the follow trigger is active for the entire time the move trigger is.**

# Non-Spawn Dependencies
## Sequential
These are triggers activated normally one after another, either being activated through **Spawn ordered,** or without being activated by **spawn-activating triggers** at all.
- The **closest** two triggers can be before **activating in the same frame** is `1.00` unit.

(Image goes here)

By using **Spawn Ordered** spawn triggers, it is possible to change the activation order **In runtime** by physically moving the triggers being activated.

## Simultaneous
The word *Simultaneous* here is A lie. When triggers activate in the same frame, the game doesn't activate all triggers in parallel, it activates triggers in a **very specific order.**

Geometry dash, like every other game, has something called a **Game Loop**. This is a loop the game runs every frame, activating different functions in a specific order. Every trigger in the level can only be activated **once**. That means unless using remaps, a trigger sequence cannot be activated twice in the same frame.

# Spawn Dependencies & Control Flow
### Branching & Merging
Branching is when one trigger calls multiple different **branches** of triggers, each branch performing different sequences of actions; each branch having the ability to be activated and controlled separately. 

(gif goes here)

Activating multiple trigger setups at the same time **does not** activate them in parralel, instead relying on the **game loop's activation order.** 

### Global vs. Local Scope
Because normally triggers activate in whats called the **Global Scope,** different branches have the ability to affect each other, especially if **both rely on the same dependencies.**
- If you have **two branches A and B**, you can make branch B interrupt A by adding a **Pause trigger that targets the original group of A.** Even though A and B are both activated by the same group, you’ll need each to have additional unique groups for this to work *(or you’re just pausing both branches)*

By using remaps, both triggers and item ids can function in the **Local Scope** instead of the global scope. This means triggers and item ids **will not interfere** with each other, even if the same function is activated. This also **removes** the possibility of two functions *(or the same function)* **having dependencies with each other.**
- If you have **function A** that moves an object depending on its location and **function B** that gets said objects location in world spcace, by using **remaps** it's possible to have 2 different objects **activate both functions** while not **interfering** with each other.
